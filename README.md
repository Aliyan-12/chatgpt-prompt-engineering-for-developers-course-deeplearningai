Key Learning Objectives:



✔️ Prompting guidelines: A model understands user's text more through delimiters, tags, steps or any provided patterns. So we must be using either delimiters(``) or any tags(<tag></tag>).



✔️ Iterative Prompt Development: You can use the model to get necessary data in different iterations as required. For example, limit the text size of model response or limit the information to technical details.



✔️ Summarizing: One other usage of LLMs is to summarize any content that can be helpful for a specific department. For example, Summarize a customer review to get a review summary for pricing and shipping department.



✔️ Inferring: We can also use the model to extract degree of anger, sentiment of a customer review, find all emotions in a review or suggest any topics from a given story.



✔️ Transforming: A Large language model is very good at translating, transforming and proof-reading a piece of text for checking grammatical mistakes.



✔️ Expanding: Using the model to write or predict new content by using user given information. The temperature parameter of a model can be adjusted to increase randomness or model as needed. Can be useful in predicting applications.



✔️ Chatbot: The last lesson was one of my favorite, where we actually created a chatbot that stores a complete series of context which is used by model to predict future answers. You can create a dashboard using panels extension from OpenAI for showing the messages.
